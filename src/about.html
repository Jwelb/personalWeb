        <h1>Story and Ambition</h1>
        <p>I grew up poor with young high school
            parents that strived to keep me happy,
            even though they worked hard to do so.
            I have always had a ambition to go to college
            because my parents never did,
            I wanted to become someone great.</p>
        <p>
            To pursue my passion for technology and programming, I want
            to become an intern to learn and experience the field of
            computer science. After my degree, I want to develop software
            that would be helpful to many people. My long-term goal in
            computer science is to eventually become a data engineer,
            become adept in machine learning and deep learning.
