            I am currently in my junior year of computer science at East Carolina University. I grew up poor with young
            high
            school parents that strived to be the best that they could be raising a son by themselves.
            I have always had a drive to go to college because my parents never did and become the someone great. To
            pursue
            my passion for technology and programming,
            I want to become an intern to learn and experience the field of computer science. After my degree, I want to
            develop software that would be helpful to many people.
            At the moment I am learning C++, JAVA at ECU, and Python/R on my own time.
            I am also investing my time into frameworks such as Springboot, and Django.
            East Carolina University is a great institution for me to learn and discuss with students to become
            successful
            within the field.
            My long-term goal in computer science is to eventually become a data engineer, become adept in machine
            learning
            and deep learning.
